# WhiledBits
This was developed as the first group project at Academia de Codigo's Bootcamp#29, at the end of the 5th week.

We've made an application that allows everyone to produce music with some sounds and samples. All the sounds were made by us, with 8-bit effect.

## Deployment
We've provided the build.xml file so you can build the .Jar with "ant" on terminal.

## Features

// Menu Options  
Instructions  
Key Cheat Sheet with keys to make some music and the credits

// Three visible groups of sounds

The fourth group (key 4) was dedicated to our Master Coders and contains some records of them.
